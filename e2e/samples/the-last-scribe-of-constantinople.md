# The Last Scribe of Constantinople

May 29, 1453. The air in Constantinople reeked of smoke and fear. Niketas, a scribe in the Hagia Sophia’s scriptorium, hunched over a parchment, his quill trembling. The city’s walls, once thought impregnable, shuddered under Ottoman cannons. For weeks, the siege had tightened like a noose, and now the end was near.

Niketas was no soldier. His world was ink, vellum, and the ancient texts he copied—Plato, Thucydides, the Gospels. The Byzantine Empire, heir to Rome, had preserved these for a millennium. But as Mehmet II’s army breached the Theodosian Walls, Niketas wondered: what use were words against steel?

The scriptorium was silent, its monks fled or dead. Niketas stayed, driven by a stubborn belief that knowledge outlasted empires. He’d heard the priests proclaim God’s protection over Constantinople, the “New Rome.” Yet the city’s defenses crumbled. Was divine favor a lie, or had the Byzantines squandered it with their infighting and pride?

A rumble shook the room. Dust fell from the ceiling, smudging his copy of Aristotle’s *Ethics*. Niketas cursed softly—ink was scarce, and this page was ruined. Outside, screams mingled with the clatter of swords. The emperor, Constantine XI, was said to be fighting at the gates, but rumors swirled that he’d fallen. Niketas didn’t know what to believe. The city had survived sieges before—Arabs, Bulgars, Rus. Why not now?

He recalled a conversation with a Genoese merchant months earlier. “Your walls are ancient,” the man had said, “but Mehmet’s cannons are new. Progress doesn’t kneel to tradition.” Niketas had scoffed, clinging to Constantinople’s legacy as the center of Christendom. Now, he questioned that arrogance. The Ottomans weren’t barbarians; their artillery, their discipline, spoke of a civilization that had outpaced Byzantium’s stagnant glory.

Footsteps echoed in the corridor. Niketas froze, clutching a codex to his chest. A figure appeared—not a Turkish soldier, but Anna, a fellow scribe, her robes stained with ash. “They’re inside the city,” she gasped. “The walls are broken. We must save what we can.”

Niketas hesitated. The scriptorium held thousands of texts—philosophy, theology, histories. To carry even a dozen would slow them down. “Which ones?” he asked.

“The oldest,” Anna said. “The ones Rome forgot and we preserved.”

They worked frantically, bundling manuscripts into sacks. Niketas chose Euclid’s *Elements*, a Psalter, and a chronicle of Justinian’s reign. Each choice felt like betrayal—every book left behind was a piece of their world lost. As they fled through the Hagia Sophia’s nave, Niketas glanced at the mosaics: Christ Pantocrator stared down, serene amid the chaos. Did He mourn the city, or had He turned away?

They reached the docks, where a Venetian galley waited, its crew shouting for stragglers. The sea was a chaos of burning ships and fleeing boats. Anna pressed a satchel into Niketas’s hands. “Take these to Italy. The scholars there will keep them alive.”

“And you?” he asked.

“I stay. Someone must witness this.”

Niketas boarded the galley, guilt gnawing at him. As the ship pulled away, he saw flames rise over Constantinople. The city that had stood for a thousand years was falling—not to divine wrath, but to human ambition and ingenuity. Mehmet’s cannons had rewritten history.

In the years that followed, Niketas lived in Venice, teaching Greek to eager scholars. The manuscripts he saved seeded a revival, later called the Renaissance. But he never forgot Anna’s face, nor the city’s final hours. Constantinople had believed itself eternal, protected by God and walls. Its fall proved no empire was invincible, no faith absolute.

Niketas wrote his own chronicle, not of emperors or battles, but of the scribes who carried fragments of a dying world into the future. He wondered if Mehmet, now styling himself “Caesar,” would preserve the city’s legacy or reshape it. History, like scripture, was written by the victors—but it was kept alive by those who refused to forget.
