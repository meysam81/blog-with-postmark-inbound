Instead, we must create our own purpose through our choices and actions. Sartre believed meaning is found in living authentically, embracing responsibility, and defining ourselves through our deeds.

All human endeavors, values, and beliefs are baseless because existence itself lacks purpose. While this can feel bleak, some find freedom in it, as it removes external pressures. However, it can also lead to despair if one cannot cope with the void.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>- **Absurdism**: Camus\u2019s absurdism offers a compromise. It recognizes the conflict between our desire for meaning and the universe\u2019s indifference but suggests we can find joy by embracing the absurdity. Meaning isn\u2019t found in ultimate truth but in the act of living\u2014loving, creating, and experiencing the world.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>- **Stoicism and Epicureanism**: Ancient philosophies provide practical approaches.
